# An Example of E-Commerce with .NET 5.0

- Domain Driven Design (aka DDD)
- .NET 5.0
- EntityFramework Core 5.0.6

## Usage

Current SQL implementation is Sqlite with in-memory option. So applications below can run directly without any database settings.

- __ECommerce.Services.Api__
- __ECommerce.Sample.ConsoleClient__

Console client has sample scenarios to run and test the application. Also fake http client implemented so it does not require api to be running. Just run and pick one of the scenarios that are already been added to project.
